Cyclistic bike-share analysis is a case study for one of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone projects.

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company operating in Chicago

The marketing director believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships and is considering a marketing strategy that aims to convert a large portion of casual riders into members.

As a junior data analyst on Cyclistic's marketing analytics team, I've been tasked with presenting to executives my findings and recommendations once I've thoroughly explored, processed, and analyzed any relevant data.

Key Findings:

1) Casual riders ride for longer periods of time than annual members

2) In view of the fact that bike usage is highest from June to September, it would be appropriate to utilize digital media to influence casual riders to become members

2) Casual riders tend to ride longer during the weekends, whereas annual members ride in a consistent manner throughout the week

4) Based on the analytics, most rides occur in the early morning hours
